### License checkers
How does software ensure it is legit with no internet access

License key checks!
- Secret algorithm that takes input, performs calc and validates as a result
- company selling the software can generate multiple valid keys
- ideally, pirates couldn't!
This method implicitly trusts the binary code to keep the secret license key verification algorithm safe


### The rise of keygens!

Pirates created keygens
- reverse engineer algorithm to understand and create valid license keys accepted by the software
- people took pride in their work!

### Simple example
Crackme's are small programs designed to test a hackers reverse engineering skillz

inspired by key verification systems

### Alternative
Cracks that patch the executable to remove the check
legally purchasing the software


### Evolution of DRM

**Anti debugging** - Techniques to fight dynamic analysis
**VMing** - Wrapping the DRM code in heavily obfuscated protected emulator for custom architecture
**Trusted Execution Environments** - Moving the DRM outside of the CPU into the protected hardware

### Reverse Engineering for Modding

When modders have run out of things they are allowed to do, they start modding code

**Skyrim Script Engine** 
**Dwarf Fortress** - DFHack
